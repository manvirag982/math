/*Zeckendorfâ€™s theorem states that every positive integer can be written uniquely as a sum of distinct non-neighbouring Fibonacci numbers. Two Fibonacci numbers are neighbours if they one come after other in Fibonacci Sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ..). For example, 3 and 5 are neighbours, but 2 and 5 are not.

Given a number, find a representation of number as sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

Examples:



Input:  n = 10
Output: 8 2
8 and 2 are two non-consecutive Fibonacci Numbers
and sum of them is 10.

Input:  n = 30
Output: 21 8 1
21, 8 and 1 are non-consecutive Fibonacci Numbers
and sum of them is 30.*/
